<hr/>
<p>In May of 2020, I wrote <a
        href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/deepnncar-a-testbed-for-autonomous-algorithms-b0db1ec4770c">my first
        technical blog on Medium</a> per the request of my research advisor and found it a great way to make technology
    understandable and accessible--also, they were fun to write! Since then, I have written more articles covering
    topics in a variety of computer science topics, like <a
        href="https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-weird-data-conformal-anomaly-detection-20afb36c7bcd">machine
        learning</a>, <a
        href="https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-a-chicken-and-egg-problem-expectation-maximization-em-c717547c3be2">statistics</a>,
    and <a
        href="https://towardsdatascience.com/a-new-tech-stack-for-your-next-machine-learning-data-visualization-project-ea64e3de3241">data
        visualizations</a> on Medium.</p>
<p>Although I like Medium and the audience the articles are able to reach, things like the paywall and the lack of
    support for code execution and mathematical equations limited the effectiveness of the articles. As a workaround, I
    made this website so that I can directly control the content of the blog. I&#39;ll see how things go, but for now, I
    plan on posting things on this site first and then later an abridged version of the articles on Medium. I am also
    using this site for general note keeping on various topics that might be less specialized than a blog post and less
    suited for Medium, but can hopefully help people working in the field or who are interested in the topics.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<hr/>
<p>I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2020 with a bachelors in computer engineering and a masters in computer
    science. During my four years, I researched at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems under the supervision
    of Dr. Abhishek Dubey and Shreyas Ramakrishna as well as other members of the SCOPE lab. My primary areas of
    interest included cyber physical systems, computer vision and deep learning, and statistical machine learning.</p>
<p>Previously, I interned at Capital One as a software developer on an internal monitoring team were I made a slack bot
    for our team&#39;s application as well as a log monitoring tool which were both deployed on AWS. Currently, I am
    working remotely for Microsoft as a software developer.</p>
