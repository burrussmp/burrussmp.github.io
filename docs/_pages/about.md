# About
Welcome to the blog! In May of 2020, I began writing a technical blog on Medium to cover topics in computer science to help make areas of the field more accessible and understandable. However, a big disadvantage on Medium is the lack of support for code execution and mathematical equations. So, I decided to make this website so that I can better explain the more technical concepts. I will see how things go, but for now I plan on posting articles both in here and on Medium.


## Education & Experiences
I graduated from Vanderbilt University with a BSc in computer engineering and a MS in computer science. During my 4 years at Vanderbilt, I conducted research with the [Institute for Software Integrated Systems](https://www.isis.vanderbilt.edu/) and wrote my Master's thesis [*Enhancing the Robustness of Deep Neural Networks using Radial Basis Functions*](https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/10082/BURRUSS-THESIS-2020.pdf?sequence=1) under the supervision of his advisor Dr. Abhishek Dubey. My area of interests include statistical machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data visualizations.

I am currently working remotely as a software engineer at Microsoft.
