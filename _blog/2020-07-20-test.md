Recently I started to learn how to use [d3.js](https://d3js.org), a JavaScript library for interactive data-driven visualizations. As a first little project, I decided to make interactive and animated versions of graphics that I originally created for two articles on wavelets ([article 1](https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/1000.php), [article 2](https://www.dsprelated.com/showarticle/1006.php)). Besides being visually appealing, I hope that this shines a bit of light at some of the deep connections and fascinating properties of wavelets. Here I narrowed down the explanations to a bares minimum, but I linked the corresponding passages in my articles in case you want to dig a little deeper.

The code is maybe a bit messy, and some things were quite tricky to accomplish or do not yet work completely as I wanted. But in general, I am very pleased with d3, it's a really powerful and fun tool that produces beautiful results. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions! $test=3$

## The Dilation and Wavelet Equation

In the Fast Wavelet Transform, the wavelets scaling function is defined by the dilation equation:

$$
\phi(t) = \sum\limits_k h_0(k) \phi(2t-k)
$$

This shows the fractal self-similarity of the scaling function: We can construct it from scaled and shifted versions of itself that are summed together. In a similar way, we can construct the wavelet function from the scaling function using the wavelet equation:

$$
\psi(t) = \sum\limits_k h_1(k) \phi(2t-k)
$$
